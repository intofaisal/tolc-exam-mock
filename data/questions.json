            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If the initial profit is P, then after the first year it becomes P × 1.15. After the second year, it becomes P × 1.15 × 0.9 = P × 1.035. This represents a 3.5% increase overall."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "The formula for effective annual rate is (1 + r/n)^n - 1, where r is the nominal rate and n is the number of compounding periods. With r = 0.04 and n = 4, we get (1 + 0.04/4)^4 - 1 = (1 + 0.01)^4 - 1 = 1.01^4 - 1 = 1.0406 - 1 = 0.0406 or 4.06%."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "If the original price is P, after the first reduction it becomes P × 0.8. After the second reduction, it becomes P × 0.8 × 0.85 = P × 0.68. This represents a 32% reduction from the original price."

            "correctAnswer": 0,
            "explanation": "Using the formula for monthly payment: P = r(PV) / (1 - (1+r)^-n), where PV is present value, r is monthly interest rate, and n is number of payments. With PV = 10000, r = 0.06/12 = 0.005, and n = 5×12 = 60, we get approximately $193.33."
