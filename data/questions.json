[1] Throughout history, publishing has adjusted to market require- ments, aiming for cheaper production and book prices in order to attract a larger number of readers. Today, in the majority of developed publishing markets, e-books have become part of the publishing business. However, every new technology can represent a factor of \"creative destruction\": transistors put an end to the cath- ode tube industry, and photocopying to the indigo paper industry. So, can the digitized book be considered a milestone in the history of publishing and what are the consequences? This study presents new trends and attempts to predict their potential impact on publishing, with a special focus on small linguistic distribution markets such as the Croatian book market. [2] While on the one hand, some experts predict the collapse of major publishers and booksellers due to their failure to focus on the future needs of readers in the digital environment, on the other, poor sales of e-publications and high prices of e-readers have led pub- lishers to question the future success of the e-publishing business. 17 2 - Reading Comprehension CISIA Œ TOLC-E Sample Test Claims that e-publishing needs to be promoted through conferences in order to become lucrative support this skepticism. However, the most likely outcome is a balance between continuity and discon- tinuity. While it is true that people do not reject their old habits and activities whenever a new technology emerges, it is commonly believed that the advancement of technology and the emergence of a simpler and cheaper process of digitization, will probably lead to an increased market for content published in digital form. [3] Seen from the perspective of aspiring authors, expert Miha Kovac af\u0002rms that digital technology has turned book publishing into one of the most democratic media industries. Today, online bookstores offer titles published by the authors themselves, without of\u0002cial publishers. Apple has launched the iBooks Author programme which allows the author to shape his work graphically and forward it di- rectly to the bookstore. Technology has cheapened and simpli\u0002ed the book publishing process, and opened the door to new players. Enriched e-books with added video and audio content offer new dimensions to the reading experience. As for the traditional role of the publisher, the rapid development of self-publishing inevitably leads to content overproduction of varying quality. Consequently, a publisher is needed to help the readers select the best content avail- able. The book chain is changing, the publisher's role is adjusting to the new system, but it is still considered very necessary. [4] So what does the future hold? On the one hand, information and communication technology is developing at such a rapid rate that future products and services cannot be easily predicted. Lead- ing companies in this \u0002eld keep their future products and services secret until market placement in order to protect themselves from 18 2 - Reading Comprehension CISIA Œ TOLC-E Sample Test competition. However, meeting the individual needs of each user is essential. With this in mind, the publishing industry has announced the emergence of the \"pay as you read\" business model allowing partial payment of content, unlike the previous practice of paying for the whole unit. This is particularly useful in the \u0002eld of academic and scienti\u0002c publications allowing, for example, each user to purchase a single article rather than an entire journal or one chapter instead of the whole book. Users can create the book they need by combining different articles or chapters. [5] There can be no doubt, therefore, that e-publishing is here to stay. However, when it comes to small markets, like Croatia, the two factors affecting the development of e-publishing are market size and language coverage. According to Digital Agenda for Europe indicators, Croatian society does not yet possess the necessary pre- requisites for successful e-publishing, but it is slowly moving towards that goal. Consequently, e-book publishing development strategies should be aimed towards ensuring a long-term cultural development in terms of digital infrastructure and internet use, whereas the con- crete implementation of this new development should be left to the market in question. 19 2 - Reading Comprehension CISIA Œ TOLC-E Sample Test TEXT I QUESTIONS"

[1] Coconut is one of the most important foods in various tropical and subtropical countries where the coconut tree is referred to as the \"tree of life\". The coconut is a very useful plant with a wide range of products being sourced from it. Coconut products are used to make everything from clothing to animal feed to beauty creams. Its kernel is harvested for its edible \u0003esh and delicious water, while its husk is used for its strong \u0002bres. Most important, however, are its oils, which are extracted, processed, and marketed for culinary, medicinal and cosmetic uses alike. The plant is cultivated in more than 90 countries with a total yield of 59 million tonnes in 2016. The production of coconut is extremely important in Asia, which is responsible for over 80 per cent of the world's coconut production. [2] In tropical countries, coconut oil has always been used as a cooking oil and in the late 19th century, the demand for edible oils also began to increase in Europe and in the US A. Once Europeans became aware of the possibilities offered by the fruit and recognised its versatility, they started establishing coconut plantations in the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and the South Paci\u0002c and from the 1890s onwards, coconut oil became very popular in European countries and in the US A as an edible oil. This \u0002rst coconut oil boom lasted 24 2 - Reading Comprehension CISIA Œ TOLC-E Sample Test until the onset of World War II, around 1940, when the supply of the product was cut off to Western countries leading to a coconut oil shortage. As a result of this scarcity, the price of the commodity surged, thus paving the way for the rival soybean oil industry to expand and develop. The shift to soybean oil was further aided by the use of more modern technology which was employed in the processing facilities of the product. [3] Once the war was over, countries with high coconut production tried to reintroduce the fruit into Western countries but with little suc- cess. Coconut oil was rejected at this point due to its high-saturated fat content. This rejection was associated with the \u0002ndings of epi- demiological studies conducted by the American physiologist, Ancel Keys, who formulated a hypothesis of the association between the consumption of high-saturated fat with a high blood cholesterol level and therefore the increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease. In 1956, in parallel to Keys' research, the American Heart Association started informing the population that consuming large quantities of high-saturated fat foods could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. This, in turn, led to a decline in the popularity of coconut oil which was known to be high in saturated fat. [4] In recent years, however, coconut oil has once again attracted the attention of the population worldwide, especially in Europe and North America. Celebrities, digital in\u0003uencers, and even doctors have endorsed the use of this oil as a cooking medium in substi- tution of other vegetable oils and as a supplementary ingredient to be consumed with coffee and vitamin shakes. Blogs, internet videos, and articles are now promoting the consumption of coconut oil as a potential \"miracl e\" food. Some media vehicles and health 25 2 - Reading Comprehension CISIA Œ TOLC-E Sample Test specialists claim that this oil is capable of promoting health bene\u0002ts, such as weight loss and the lowering of cholesterol levels as well as having anti-in\u0003ammatory effects and it is now af\u0002rmed that the consumption of coconut oil may actually help in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Clearly, these claims are now being used by coconut oil companies to market the product and boost sales. Nevertheless, governmental regulatory agencies in many countries remain sceptical about the bene\u0002ts obtained by the consumption of coconut oil due to its high-saturated fatty acid content. In gen- eral, studies in this \u0002eld present con\u0003icting results and there is a serious lack of long term human-based clinical trials. Therefore, as a saturated fat, coconut oil should be consumed with moderation and the health allegations should not be used to market the product considering that they have not been scienti\u0002cally proven so far. 26 2 - Reading Comprehension CISIA Œ TOLC-E Sample Test TEXT II QUESTIONS"
